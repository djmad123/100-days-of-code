# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 - Mar 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on creating JS Clock

**Thoughts:** not sure where to start with new projects. But, here is suggested:
Pick a language (prefer JS)
Learn 2 concepts each day & implement them in JS
pick any small project form github or any where just spend hours on understanding the code, the flow, code structure.
Clone the project, play with code
Once you are comfortable, try to add a new functionality



### Day 2: 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
