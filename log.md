# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Mar 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Suggested starting with JS Clock.

Pick a language (prefer JS)
1) Learn 2 concepts each day & implement them in JS

2) pick any small project form github or any where just spend hours on understanding the code, the flow, code structure.

3) Clone the project, play with code

4) Once you are comfortable, try to add a new functionality

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
